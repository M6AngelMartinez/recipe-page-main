## My process

In this challenge, I analyzed the design and was able to replicate it with ease. My biggest difficulty was positioning and aligning the elements, which made the process somewhat long and tedious. However, after many attempts and with the help of resources like AI and videos, I was able to complete it with great satisfaction.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM Methodology
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to properly use tables and lists, and how to fix overflow issues and layout breaking on small screens.


### Continued development

I want to keep learning more about Flexbox to improve element spacing and alignment, how to fix overflow issues, build responsive designs, and apply proper semantic HTML structure.
